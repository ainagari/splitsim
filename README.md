# 💔 Impact of Word Splitting on the Semantic Content of Contextualized Word Representations 🖖🏻

This repository contains data (and soon code) for the paper:

Aina Garí Soler, Matthieu Labeau and Chloé Clavel (2024). Impact of Word Splitting on the Semantic Content of Contextualized Word Representations. To appear in Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (TACL).


### The SPLIT-SIM dataset

The dataset is found in the `SPLIT-SIM/` directory, separated into four `.tsv` files, one for each type of word (monosemous/polysemous nouns/verbs). Files contain word pairs together with their wup similarity, their split-type according to different language models, and the frequency and tokenization of each word in a pair.
